Android App: Binary coded ASCII
===============================

This is a test appicaiton used to enter
ASCII character codes in binary using
one button for 0 and another for 1. It was
intended to be used by an Arduino
interfacing through two pieces of
tin-foil to simulte touch screen
presses. This failed but I'm posting
the code in case it's useful to someone
or I get the itch to take up the
project once again.

Here's the inspirtion for the hardware
interface:

And this is a brief video demo of the app:
